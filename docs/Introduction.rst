Introduction
============
A Python package paw\_structure was developed to conduct a structural analysis of ab-*initio* molecular dynamics simulations performed by the CP-PAW code.

Note, that the program package is still in development and especially the documentation might be subject to change and only represents the latest stable release. No guarantee can be provided for the correctness and completeness of the project.
